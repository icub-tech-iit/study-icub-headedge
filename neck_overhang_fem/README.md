This folder contains 2 examples of finite element analysis( static, modal, and dynamic).
 
 "Fem beam" is a simple case of a beam loaded at one end and fixed at the other. To evaluate the correctness of the settings configured in Creo9 Simulate, the same identical analysis was also performed using dedicated tools in MatlabR2024a.
 The results match.

 "femgreen_g_01" is a specific analysis performed on a part extracted from the neck to assess the magnitude and duration of residual oscillations after the end of the periodic disturbances generated during the robot's gait cycle.
